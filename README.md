# U.S. States Game
# made by keshav kumar jha 

This is a Python game to learn the names of the U.S. states. The game displays a map of the U.S. and prompts the user to enter the names of the states. As each state is correctly guessed, it is filled in on the map. 

The game utilizes the turtle module to display the map and state names. It reads in state name and coordinate data from a CSV file.

Features:

- Interactive map of the U.S. states
- State names are filled in as the user guesses them  
- Tracks the number of correct guesses
- Exports a CSV of states not guessed to study
- Utilizes turtle graphics and pandas 

This project is a great way to learn U.S. geography while practicing Python skills. The code is well-commented for learning and customization.

Some ways the game could be expanded:

- Add state capitals
- Include more geography trivia 
- Time the game 
- Difficulty levels
- Nicer visual interface

Overall, it's a simple but fun Python project to work on U.S. states knowledge.
